# Unit-2-Build-week-app

To finish up Unit 2-Predictive Modeling at Lambda School, we are required to complete an individual project. This repository is for that Unit 2 Build Week Project. 

You can view the IPython notebook for the predictive models here: https://github.com/cryptobellum/Unit-2-Build-week-app/blob/main/Unit_2_Build_Week_Crossfit.ipynb

The corresponding blog post for this proejct can be read at: https://medium.com/@Cryptobellum/which-crossfit-athletes-have-competitive-potential-for-the-sport-of-weightlifting-4d233cca44dd

This IPython notebook includes a preditive model based on an abbreviated feature matrix of the models contained in the notebook above: https://github.com/cryptobellum/Unit-2-Build-week-app/blob/main/Unit-2-Build-week-app/PlotlyDashapp.ipynb

I selected the top three features from the feature matrix of the initial models to be able to reach the stretch goal of deploying a Plotly Dash app to Heroku. You can see that app here: https://w8lifter.herokuapp.com/

The app is fully-functional and deployed as of March 4, 2021, but it is a work in progress.
